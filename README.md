# SmartInstantBI-Automated-powerBI-Dashboard-generater
The project builds an AI chatbot that automates business dashboard creation. Users type queries like “Show me sales by region for 2024.” The bot uses NLP to understand the query, converts it into SQL, fetches data from SQL Server, and auto-generates an interactive Power BI dashboard—removing manual SQL and design work.
