🧠 Data Bot — Setup & Usage Guide

Welcome to Data Bot — a local AI-powered data dashboard built using Python, Streamlit, and Ollama.
This guide will help you set up everything step-by-step, even if you’ve never used Python before.

🚀 1. Getting Started (First-Time Setup)

Follow these steps the first time you run this project:

Download and Extract the entire project folder data-bot anywhere on your computer (e.g. D:\Projects\data-bot or X:\data-bot).

Open the folder and locate:

first_time_run.bat

run.bat

The resources folder (contains requirements.txt)

Double-click first_time_run.bat.

This script will automatically:

Create a virtual environment (venv) for isolated dependencies.

Install Python libraries (Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, etc.).

Install Ollama (the local AI backend).

Download the Gemma3:1b AI model for offline processing.

Once the setup is complete, you’ll see:

[✅] Setup completed successfully!
You can now run the app using run.bat

▶️ 2. Running the Dashboard

After the first setup:

Simply double-click run.bat.

The script will:

Activate the virtual environment.

Start the Ollama background service.

Launch Streamlit automatically.

Wait a few seconds — your default browser will open at:

http://localhost:8501


Enjoy your interactive data dashboard!

🧩 4. What’s a Virtual Environment (venv)?

A virtual environment is a safe, isolated space where all your project’s packages are stored.
This ensures your system’s Python or other projects don’t get affected.

Created automatically by first_time_run.bat

Located at: data-bot/venv

Activated automatically by run.bat

You don’t need to touch it manually!

⚙️ 5. Key Components
Component	Description
Streamlit	The framework that powers the dashboard interface.
Pandas / NumPy	Used for data processing and manipulation.
Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly	Libraries for charts and visualizations.
Tabulate	Helps display tables neatly.
Ollama	Local AI engine that runs models like Gemma3.
Gemma3:1b	The default AI model (works well without a GPU).
💡 6. Troubleshooting
❌ “Python not found”

→ Install Python 3.9 or higher from python.org/downloads
.
Make sure you tick “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

❌ “Streamlit not opening in browser”

→ Manually open http://localhost:8501
 in your browser after running run.bat.

❌ “Model not found” or “Ollama serve failed”

→ Run ollama serve once manually in Command Prompt, then re-run run.bat.

❌ “Tabulate missing” or dependency error

→ Activate your venv manually:

venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r resources\requirements.txt


Then rerun run.bat.

🧠 7. Tips

To update libraries later:

pip install -r resources\requirements.txt --upgrade


You can copy this entire folder to another PC — it’s fully portable.

Just rerun first_time_run.bat once on that system to set everything up.

✨ 8. Summary
Step	Action	Run
1️⃣	First-time setup (creates venv, installs everything)	first_time_run.bat
2️⃣	Daily usage (launch dashboard & Ollama)	run.bat
3️⃣	Optional manual dependency update	pip install -r resources\requirements.txt --upgrade

Now you’re ready to explore your AI-powered Data Dashboard!
If your friend just copies this folder, they only need to run first_time_run.bat once — everything else happens automatically 🚀
